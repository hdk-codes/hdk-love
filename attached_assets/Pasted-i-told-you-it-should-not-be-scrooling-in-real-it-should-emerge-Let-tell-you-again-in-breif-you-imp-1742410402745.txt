The Landing Page: A Heartfelt Welcome

When you first open the website, you’re greeted with a typing animation that spells out “Hi love ❣️”, letter by letter, as if I’m typing it to you in real time. The heart at the end isn’t just an emoji—it’s the core of the website, a 3D, interactive heart that pulses gently with a soft glow. This heart is alive and dynamic:

    Desktop: Move your cursor closer, and it beats faster, zooms in slightly, and glows brighter, as if it senses you.
    Mobile: Bring your finger near it or tilt your phone, and it responds the same way—pulsing with excitement, maybe even shifting colors from a warm pink to a radiant red.

It’s the soul of the site, a constant presence that reacts to your every touch, making you feel my love in real time.

After the greeting, a subtle “Scroll down” prompt appears—perhaps a delicate arrow or a gentle nudge animation—inviting you into the magic that awaits.
The Scroll: A Journey of Surprises

As you scroll, the “Hi love ❣️” text doesn’t just fade—it transforms with a beautiful animation. Each letter zooms in slightly, then disperses into a shower of tiny particles—like glittering dust or fireflies—floating away to reveal what’s beneath. It’s the first hint that this website is a gift being unwrapped.
Layer 1: The Birthday Card

From behind the fading text emerges a dynamic birthday card, not flat but 3D and immersive, like a real greeting card you can almost touch. It unfolds as you scroll, revealing layers of love:

    First Unfold: A stunning illustration—maybe of us, or a scene you adore—with the message “Happy Birthday to the most gorgeous girl in the world.” The text shimmers as if written in golden ink.
    Second Unfold: Scroll more, and another layer opens, revealing a heartfelt note or poem: “To my love, you light up my world every day…” The words fade in gently, as if I’m writing them live.
    Third Unfold: Interactive elements appear—tap a heart, and it bursts into confetti, revealing a hidden message like “You’re my everything.”

The card is alive with immersive animations—flowers that bloom, stars that twinkle—all designed to make you smile.
Layer 2: The Dispersion Effect & Foldable Card

Scroll further, and the birthday card transitions with a dispersion effect. It breaks apart into swirling particles that reassemble into a new treasure: a foldable love letter. This isn’t just a card—it’s a 3D pop-up experience:

    Hover or Tap: The letter unfolds, revealing a miniature scene inside—perhaps a tiny version of our favorite place, or a sky of floating hearts and stars.
    Interaction: Touch or move over it, and the elements inside shift—hearts float higher, stars sparkle brighter—making it feel like a living storybook.

This section is packed with advanced animations, giving you the thrill of discovery with every move.
